# Talk: Kotlin on CRaC â€“ new JVM features to speed things up

Talk for [Droidcon Berlin 2025](https://berlin.droidcon.com/speakers/marc-reichelt).

- Slides: coming shortly
- Video recording: will be available a few weeks after the conference

## Talk Description

What if we could drastically improve the JVM startup time? What if we could start a Kotlin-powered backend in milliseconds?

Let's explore some exciting new JVM features like the experimental [CRaC](https://openjdk.org/projects/crac/) (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) and [JEP 483](https://openjdk.org/jeps/483) (Ahead-of-Time Class Loading & Linking) from Project Leyden, a feature of JDK 24! How fast are they, and how are they different from GraalVM and Kotlin Native?

Finally, let's go completely wild, and experiment with a crazy idea: Let's see if we can apply these technologies to make our Gradle unit test workflows in Android projects faster as well!
